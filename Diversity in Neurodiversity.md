# If you are neurodiverse and you suspect a friend or colleague is as well.

[.footer: We don't share because usually a diagnosis brings about other emotions and feelings]

# No Two Cases are the Same #
- **DON'T** assume what's worked for one will work for all
- That's why it's important to showcase many different solutions and treat **ALL** of them as **VALID**

[.footer: Also don't be comparative]

# ~~"I have a friend who is ______"~~

[.footer: I don't know your friend. And their situation and life circumstances is not equivalent to mine (for better or worse)]

# Instead
- "**What have you tried** that worked in the past"
- "**If you want** to talk about it, I can make time. I may not understand it all but if you can help me I'll try my best"
- "Let me know how I can help you. Even if you just need me to cover for you while you **adjust**"

[.footer: We've been self treating for years at this point.]
